# Problem Statement
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.

# Object
You will produce a report with the following deliverables:
1) A clear statement of the business task
2) A description of all data sources used
3) Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4) A summary of your analysis
5) Supporting visualizations and key findings
6) Your top three recommendations based on your analysis

# Dataset

We used Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This
means that you won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the
Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.
